/* The it in the function name refers to the noun you 
used to name your test suite

Starting in React 18, the render function is asynchronous: 
the function call will return before React has modified the DOM. 
Therefore, the expectation will run before the DOM is modified.

React provides a helper function for our tests that pauses until 
asynchronous rendering has completed. Itâ€™s called act and you simply 
need to wrap it around any React API calls.
